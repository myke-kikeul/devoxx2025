# Keycloak : de sacr√©s attributs!
I used a Keycloak 26.1.4 version. Middle-earth realm export is available under keycloak folder.
You can also customize login screen with the folder (a little bit useless indeed?!)

Start each quarkus project to be able to call "pay-me" service for hobbit, dwarf or elf.
